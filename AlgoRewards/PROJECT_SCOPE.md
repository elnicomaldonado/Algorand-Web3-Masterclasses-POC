# 🧭 Project Scope: AlgoRewards – POAP-style MVP on Algorand

## 🎯 Objective

Create a proof-of-concept (MVP) Web3 application on the Algorand blockchain that allows event participants (e.g. Web3 Masterclass attendees) to claim unique NFT badges as proof of attendance.

Inspired by [POAP.xyz](https://poap.xyz), this tool aims to make it easy to issue and claim NFTs linked to specific sessions or events.

---

## 🎯 Problem to Solve

Participants in decentralized learning experiences (like masterclasses or hackathons) have no verifiable, on-chain way to prove they attended sessions or completed activities. AlgoRewards offers an easy, trustless solution.

---

## ✅ MVP Scope – What Will Be Built

### 🔐 Smart Contract
- Mint a **non-transferable NFT** (Algorand Standard Asset with 1 unit)
- Ensure each address can mint **only once per session**
- Store a basic on-chain state of which addresses have claimed

### 🖥 Frontend (React + Vite)
- Connect Algorand wallet (Pera/WalletConnect)
- Show session mint button via link or QR code
- Trigger claim transaction
- Display success or "already claimed" state

### 🔗 Session Metadata
- NFT asset name, image, and description tied to session number/date
- Stored as static JSON or on IPFS (simple structure)

### 📱 QR Code
- Each session has a unique QR code that points to its minting page

---

## ❌ Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Complex user authentication or email systems
- Backend servers or databases
- On-chain leaderboard or reward levels
- Advanced gamification (referrals, bonus logic, staking)
- Marketplace or transfer/sale of NFTs
- Real ALGO tokens as rewards

---

## 👥 Users

- **Attendees**: Scan a QR at the end of a session, connect wallet, and claim NFT.
- **Organizers**: Deploy session NFTs and distribute mint links or QR codes.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: AlgoPy + AlgoKit
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) + use-wallet + TailwindCSS
- **Wallets**: Pera Wallet (via WalletConnect)
- **Metadata Hosting**: Static JSON or IPFS
- **QR Codes**: Local generator with `qrcode` npm library

---

## 🗓 Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Define scope and deploy basic smart contract to TestNet | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| 2 | Mint static NFT with hardcoded metadata | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| 3 | Connect frontend to wallet and mint function | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| 4 | Add QR support and "already claimed" logic | ✅ **COMPLETED** |
| 5 | Bonus logic: "collect all" or "reward top" prototype | 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** |
